# Project Name & Description

## Frello

Frello is a full-stack kanban task management application that let the user manage tasks by creating boards and columns and adding tasks to those columns.
Angular was used for the front-end of the application. 

## Live Project

### Note on Usage
You may experience a response delay of up to 30 seconds when requesting a board after a period of inactivity due to the fact the server is spun down after 15 minutes of inactivity. 

# Project Status

I am currently in the process of adding authentication to the app.
